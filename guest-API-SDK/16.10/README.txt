Wind River Titanium Server guest-API-SDK provides a language independent SDK and API set to enable virtual machine guest heartbeating, guest scaling, and server group messaging. These API's provide an open and flexible implementation for these functions.

The guest-API-SDK provides a set of instructions (README and PDF documentation), example code and open protocols that leverage JSON formats for configuration and usage of the API/SDK.

We welcome all feedback, bug reports and ideas on how to improve the API's and SDK.
