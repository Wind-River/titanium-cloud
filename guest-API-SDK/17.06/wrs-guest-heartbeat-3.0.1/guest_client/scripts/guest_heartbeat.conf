## Heartbeat health check options

## This specifies the interval between heartbeats in milliseconds between the
## guest-client heartbeat and the Titanium Cloud Compute Services on the
## compute node host.
HB_INTERVAL=1000

## This specifies the corrective action against the VM in the case of a
## heartbeat failure between the guest-client and Titanium Cloud Compute
## Services on the compute node host and also when the health script
## configured below fails.
##
## Your options are:
##   "log"     Only a log is issued.
##   "reboot"  Issue a reboot against this VM.
##   "stop"    Issue a stop against this VM.
##
CORRECTIVE_ACTION="reboot"


##################################################
## Heartbeat event notification and voting options

## The overall time to vote in seconds regardless of the event being voted
## upon.  It should reflect the slowest of all expected voters when in a sane
## and healthy condition, plus some allowance for scheduling and messaging.
VOTE=8

## The overall time to handle a stop or reboot notification in seconds.
## It should reflect the slowest of all expected notification handlers
## when in a sane and healthy condition, plus some allowance for scheduling
## and messaging.
SHUTDOWN_NOTICE=8

## The overall time to handle a pause, suspend or migrate-begin notification
## in seconds.  It should reflect the slowest of all expected notification
## handlers when in a sane and healthy condition, plus some allowance for
## scheduling and messaging.
SUSPEND_NOTICE=8

## The overall time to handle an unpause, resume or migrate-end notification
## in seconds.  It should reflect the slowest of all expected notification
## handlers when in a sane and healthy condition, plus some allowance for
## scheduling and messaging.  It does not include reboot time.
RESUME_NOTICE=13

## The overall time to reboot, up to the point the guest-client heartbeat
## starts in seconds.  Allow for some I/O contention.
RESTART=600


##################################################
## The Path to the health check script. This is optional.
## The script will be called periodically to check for the health of the VM.
## The health check interval is specified in seconds.
HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL=30
HEALTH_CHECK_SCRIPT="/etc/guest-client/heartbeat/sample_health_check_script"


##################################################
## The Path to the event notification script. This is optional.
## The script will be called when an action is initiated that will impact
## the VM.
##
## The event handling script is invoked with two parameters:
##
##   event_handling_script <MSG_TYPE> <EVENT>
##
##     MSG_TYPE is one of:
##       'revocable'    Indicating a vote is called for.  Return zero to accept,
##                      non-zero to reject.  For a rejection, the first line of
##                      stdout emitted by the script will be captured and logged
##                      logged indicating why the event was rejected.
##
##       'irrevocable'  Indicating this is a notification only. Take preparatory
##                      actions and return zero if successful, or non-zero on
##                      failure.  For a failure, the first line of stdout
##                      emitted by the script will be captured and logged
##                      indicating the cause of the failure.
##
##     EVENT is one of: ( 'stop',  'reboot',  'pause', 'unpause', 'suspend',
##                        'resume', 'live_migrate_begin',
##                        'live_migrate_end', 'cold_migrate_begin',
##                        'cold_migrate_end' )
