TITANIUM CLOUD - GUEST HEARTBEAT SDK
===========================================

DESCRIPTION
===========
    Titanium Cloud Guest-Client provides a heartbeat service to monitor the
    health of guest application(s) within a VM running under WindRiver's
    Titanium Cloud.  Loss of heartbeat will result in a corrective action
    being taken against the VM.  The heartbeat interval and corrective action
    is specified by the VM.

    Titanium Cloud Guest-Client also provides guest application(s) within
    a VM running under WindRiver's Titanium Cloud, the ability to receive
    notification of and vote to accept or reject actions about to be performed
    against the VM.  On notifications, the guest application within the VM can
    take this opportunity to cleanly shut down or transfer its service to a
    peer VM.
