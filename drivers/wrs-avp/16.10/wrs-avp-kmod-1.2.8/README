DESCRIPTION
===========
Titanium Server AVP virtual NIC is a shared memory based high performance
networking device.  Its potential maximum throughput is higher than other
standard virtual NIC devices (e.g., e1000, virtio).  This package provides the
AVP Linux kernel device driver source.  It can be compiled against most recent
Linux kernel distributions.


REQUIREMENTS
============
    Compilation:
        64-bit Linux Kernel
           version >= 3.2
           loadable module support
           PCI device support
        gcc compiler

    VM Runtime:
        AVP type virtual NIC

DELIVERABLE
===========
Titanium Server AVP Linux kernel device driver is delivered as source with the
required makefiles in a compressed tarball, such that it can be compiled for
the applicable guest linux distribution as an external kernel module.


COMPILE
=======
Extract the tarball contents ...

   mkdir -p /tmp/wrs; cd /tmp/wrs
   tar xvf wrs-avp-kmod-1.2.8.tgz
   export WRS_SDK=${PWD}/wrs-avp-kmod-1.2.8

To compile, change directories and run make.  This will produce 'wrs_avp.ko'.

   unset RTE_SDK
   make -C ${WRS_SDK}


INSTALL
=======
To install the wrs_avp.ko kernel module that was just built the following
command can be run from the same directory as the previous step.  This will
install the kernel module to the default external module directory which is
specific to your system.  Typically this is:

   /lib/modules/`uname -r`/extra

   sudo make -C ${WRS_SDK} modules_install
   sudo depmod -a
   sudo modprobe wrs_avp


CONFIGURATION and USAGE
=======================
Loading the module with no parameters will allow the AVP kernel threads that
are dedicated to receiving packets to be affined to all online CPUs.  If the
list of candidate CPUs must be restricted then the kthread_cpulist module
parameter can be used.

   modprobe wrs_avp kthread_cpulist=0-2


HARDWARE OFFLOAD FEATURES
=======================
The WRS AVP kernel module supports the following hardware offload features.
Unless stated otherwise, all other offload capabilities are not supported and
should not be specified.

1.  VLAN insert and strip. 

  This feature allows the guest and host to exchange VLAN tagging information
  in packet metadata rather than modifying packet headers to add and remove
  VLAN tagging information.  In many circumstances this capability reduces CPU
  cost associated to processing VLAN tagged packets at both the guest and host
  levels.  The ability to enable or disable this feature via ethtool is
  currently not supported.  It is enabled by default when the host device
  reports that it supports VLAN offload capabilities.
